Instructions
- Grab the starting template here: https://codesandbox.io/s/js-exercise-galaxy-immigration-desk-starter-template-yf277
- Read the "Star Wars API" documentation: https://swapi.dev/documentation
- Think about which resources you are going to use
- Create a state object
- Create fetch functions to get data
- Create render functions that read from state

Tips
- Start with the logic first, use console.log(state) to check your logic is working; when the logic is working as expected move onto styling
- Notice the url to other SWAPI resources in the data; think about what you need and make multiple fetch requests before adding data to state

Challenge (extra day of work)
Create the "Starship Hangar" page, not another HTML page, where:
    - A user can view a list of starships that belong to the accepted immigration applicants
    - From the list of starships, a user can:
        - View info on the starship in the info section
        - And, view the crew of the starship in the action section
    - From the action section, a user can:
        - Launch a ship from the space station
        - And, remove the starship from the list of starships
        - And, remove the crew from the applicant section on the "Crew Deck" page
